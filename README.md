## How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

In this case study I am going to tackle the question: ***How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*** 

**Note:** That this notebook presentation is to highlight my skills as a Data Analyst so this presentation is more about me explaining my work step by step and is not a 
concise slideshow that you will present to stakeholders.

### Background Story

I am working as a junior data analyst working for a company called Cyclistic. The company found out that annual members are more profitable compared to casual riders.
Now the company is trying to figure out how to convert casual riders into annual members to increase profits. My marketing team is assigned three questions to answer:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

As you have heard before I am tasked to answer the question: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**. 
This is the summarize story as to why I am creating this presentation before you.
